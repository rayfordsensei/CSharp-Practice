# C# Practice Projects

Hi there, this git repo is where I store and share various C# projects I've created while learning and practicing the language. Each project is a small, self-contained application that demonstrates my knowledge. All projects are compiled against NET 9.0.
## Projects

1. **Console Calculator**
   - A simple console-based calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

2. **Console ToDoList**
   - A console-based task management tool that lets users create, read, update, delete and track tasks with details like title, description, status and due date.
